This repository consists of different classification models trained on the Fassion Mnist data set.
____

## ABOUT THE DATA SET
The images and labels used to train all the models in the repositary was loaded directly from KERAS using the below command
```sh
# To load data
(x_train,y_train),(x_test,y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.fassion_mnist.load_data()
```
The train data has 60000 samples and the test data has 10000 samples which sums up to a total of 70000 samples.
Each image has a resolution of 28X28 which gives us 784 pixels when flattened.

There are a total number of 10 classes of images and every image has its label.

## CLASSIFICATION MODELS
Four machine_learning models and three deep_learning models were trained out of which the simple artificial nural network named ANN1 gave the best results. Below are the resuls of different models.
